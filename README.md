# Cross_Domain_Knowledge_Mapping
This project focuses on mapping and analyzing knowledge across multiple domains using a curated NLP dataset. It integrates data from ten diverse fields to create a unified knowledge graph for better insights and exploration.

## Dataset

The dataset used, `cross_domain_nlp_dataset_5000.csv`, contains around 5000 rows and 4 columns. It covers ten domains: Sociology, Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics, Economics, Psychology, Physics, Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Biology. Choosing rich and clean datasets like those from Kaggle (e.g., Reuters) is essential for effective NLP model training and evaluation.

## Libraries Used

This project relies on several Python libraries for data processing, NLP, and visualization:
pip install pandas numpy spacy textacy nltk scikit-learn networkx matplotlib pyvis openpyxl regex transformers
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


## Features

- Cross-domain NLP dataset integration
- Knowledge graph creation and visualization
- Support for 10 diverse academic and scientific domains


## Usage

Include instructions for running scripts or visualizations here (e.g., Python command to run main script).


## License

This project currently does not include a license.
